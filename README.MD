Machine Learning for Retail Sales Forecasting â€” Features Engineering ðŸ“ˆ
Understand the impacts of additional features related to stock-out, store closing date or cannibalization on a Machine Learning model for sales forecasting



Machine Learning models can reduce the forecasting error by 20% to 60% compared to benchmark statistical models.

Their major advantage is the capacity to include external features that heavily impact the variability of your sales.

For example, e-commerce cosmetics sales are driven by *special events (promotions) and on how you advertise a reference on the website.
This process called features engineering is based on analytical concepts and business insights to understand what could drive your sales.
